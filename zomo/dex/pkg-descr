Dex is an identity service that uses OpenID Connect to drive authentication for other apps.

Dex acts as a portal to other identity providers through "connectors." This
lets dex defer authentication to LDAP servers, SAML providers, or established
identity providers like GitHub, Google, and Active Directory. Clients write
their authentication logic once to talk to dex, then dex handles the protocols
for a given backend.
